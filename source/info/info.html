          What is Purify all about?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Every time we ask Google to search for something requests are sent back and forth.
          Internet Service Providers need electricity to keep the internet
          running and Google needs electricity for their servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          1) Careful estimates believe that each Google search amounts to at least 0.3 Wh,
          which in turn amounts to no less than 0.2 g of CO

        <p>
          2) The most common searches on Google are aimed at popular web services,
          like facebook, YouTube, and even Google itself. These trivial searches
          can be prevented.
